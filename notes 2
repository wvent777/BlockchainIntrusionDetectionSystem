Proposed architecture uses both types of detection meth-
ods as signature-based as well as anomaly based for attack detection and improving the
security of network. Blockchain is used for signature transfer and it would be of its first
kind to be used in distributed IDS as per our knowledge. This model is proposed for
a distributed environment where each node is connected to the other in a distributed
fashion. Each node will be able to detect attacks by analyzing packets entering through
the network. 

In this phase, all classifiers are
trained using the modern CIC-IDS 2017 dataset. Classifiers which are used in this phase
are artificial neural network (ANN), Isolation Random Forest (IRF), and XG boost. 

 * Check other Classifiers that could be used 

 talk in this paper the way the classification could be used for ADS and then explain in the system paper how to incorporate it to the network 

 # Classifiers are ANN
# Isolation Random Forest
# XG Boost
# These all classifiers will ensemble together to get the final prediction of the analysis using
# majority voting algorithm
# Network Intrustion Detection (NIDS)
# Host-based intrustion Detection (HIDS)

# Hybrid Intrusion detection system 
# made up of two or more IDS techniques, i.e. NIDS and HIDS
# done to increase efficiency, as it allows detecting both known and unknown attacks
# a complete view of the network is created by combining host agents or system data 
# with network information, this system is more effective in comparison to other IDS

# For anomaly Detection

Genetic algorithm is used to find the normal behavior patterns for all normal activities
# CIC-IDS is used as the input 
- rule based classifiers are used to train the classifiers
- if packet of data matches with at least one of the rules then it is considered as normal

- Fitness is calculated for each feature set and the feature having strong fitness values will be considered for the rule based dataset generation
- this dataset is then used to train classifiers 
# Threshold considered for the fitness value is 0.90 
All chromosomes with a value nearer to the threshold are
considered for dataset generation. Classifiers used are ANN, IRF, and XG-boost.


Fitness value = (a/A) - (b/B)
A is total number of attacks
a - number of attack connections correctly classified by individual classifier

B - Normal connections in the population
b - number of normal connections correctly classified by classifiers
